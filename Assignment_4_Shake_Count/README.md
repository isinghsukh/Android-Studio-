# A4: Real-time smartphone sensor data processing. Accelerometer/Gyroscope applications (Sukhwinder Singh)

## Overview

I build an app that rings when the count goes upto over 10.

## Using the app 

The working of the App is very simple. When we shake the phone. The phone detect the number of counts and just over the 10. It start ringing. Below is the Stop button which can we used to stop the ring and reset the count to 0.

## Walkthrough

There are 3 three Screenshots in the folder imgs

Screenshot 1 - Shows the intial layout
Screenshot 2 Show the count upto 8
Screenshot 3 Shows the count of 11 and the phone start ringing

Summary: The project is to count the shakes and show the number of counts and play a ringtone. During the project coding. I had experienced an issue to stop the ringtone when we give the command. But it was fixed later and the choise to renerate the tone or to choose arbitrary tones.
